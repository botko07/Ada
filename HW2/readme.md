For mark 2.
Create a Conveyer_System generic package.

The generic parameters are:

Item: discrete type, possible items of the conveyor belt. Suppose the first element is the empty element, this will be used in places where we donâ€™t want item. E.g. in main program use type Toys is (Nothing, Car, Doll, Ball);
Index: discrete type, the index of the belt.
The Conveyor type:

The package has a private type Conveyor with discriminant, which has no equality and assignment defined. The internal representation should be a record with discriminant, the type parameter is the size of the belt. The fields of the record are:

Items: the array of the belt, the size is equal to the capacity, initialize all with the first element of the type Item.
Robot_Position: the position of the robot, initially first position.
Operations to be implemented:

Move_Robot: receives an index of type Index, places the robot arm to that index.
Put: receives an Item, places to the actual position of the robot.
Get: gets the item from where the robot is and returns it.
Show: Prints the content of the belt.
For mark 2 the belt is not moving, it is static. Write a demo to illustrate the above operations.

For mark 3.
Create a Rotate generic procedure (in separate files), which rotates the elements of an array. The generic parameters are:

Item: arbitrary type, which has equality and assignment.
Index: discrete type.
Item_Array: an array of Item-s with Index indefinite array range.
The procedure has an in and out Item_Array parameter. It should shift the elements to the left, so i receives the i+1 element, at last position it should be the first element.

The Conveyer_System generic package should be extended by Move operation, which shifts the belt to the left. For implementation use the above Rotate generic.

Write a demo to illustrate how the moving operation works.

For mark 4.
Extend the package by two exceptions Slot_Is_Empty, Slot_Not_Empty which will be raised if we get a value from an empty place, and if we insert in an occupied place. Extend the Rotate generic procedure with a logical parameter, if it is true rotate the items to right, if false rotate to left.

Insert in the Conveyer_System generic package an enumeration type which stores two direction values. The Move should have a second parameter of this type with default value left direction. For implementation use the modified Rotategeneric. Write a demo to illustrate the above operations.

For mark 5.
The Conveyer_System generic package should be extended by new generic parameter: Put_Nothing. In the Show operation call this procedure if the field is empty, i.e. the first value of Item is there. In demo instantiate with a printing procedure that prints a "*" character.

Extend in the Conveyer_System generic package with a Command enumeration type, with the following values: Move_Left, Move_Right, Put, Get. Define an Algorithm type which is an array containing Command elements. Write a Run procedure which receives an algorithm and a number of iterations, and it executes the algorithm as many times as is in iterations.

Help:

The Put should place a random item on the belt. This can be done with Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random generic package, which should be instantiated with the name Random_Item using the Item type (or a subtype of it, which has as first element Nothing). In the following find how a random can be done.
